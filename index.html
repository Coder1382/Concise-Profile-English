    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <section>
      After graduation from Kazan Federal University as Geologist, I worked in that occupation, including at a rotational basis at different sites.
      Several years later, I became interested in the IT industry due to its ever-increasing importancy.<br>
      Global changes and the consequent global crisis urged me to switch to other fields of business activity. I focused on frellancing as a translator 
	  from English to Russian and vice versa because it was an appropriate choice in terms of earnings.<br>
      However, I felt a need in further professional development, therefore, I took on learning programming languages. 
	  I had been improving my skills via relevant books, relevant videos in the Inthernet, and practicing in coding. <br>
      Since October 2023, I am a student of School 21 patronized by Sber. Upon attaining the level 10, I decided to major in Java language.
      I had completed all necessary projects in C/C++, including games Teris and Snake with use of Qt library.
	  In the Java language I have just completed the Rogue Game project with use of Jcurses library<br>
      Among others, I have written a REST API app in Java for managing databases, a browser game in JavaScript, three Telegram bots in Python etc.

    In <a href="https://github.com/Coder1382/Browser-Game">Browser Game</a>
    a triangle subject travels along the screen among square obstacles that move towards it.
    The control is performed via arrow keys Left/Right/Up/Down; to travel faster, tap a respective arrow key.
    In the game, there are three levels differing in the rate of appearance of obstacles. In the level 3, obstacles rotate.
    You can start playing by following <a href="https://coder1382.github.io/Browser-Game/">the link</a> file.
    The project is written in JavaScript, HTML. CSS.

    <a href="https://github.com/Coder1382/REST-API-Java-PostgreSQL-JDBC">REST API application</a>
    implements One-to-Many and Many-toMany relations, as well as processes requests as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>show all table records / one table record (GET request with/without parameter)</li>
    <li>add a table record (POST request)</li>
    <li>update a table record (PUT request)</li>
    <li>delete a table record (DELETE request)</li>
    </ul>
    There are three table at hand: Fruit, Sellers. Suppliers.
    A record in the Fruit table includes of two mandatory fields: Name and Price. Each record has a list of sellers.
    User can update the price, as well as add/remove sellers to/from the list.<br>
    A record in the Sellers table includes one mandatory field Name, and one optional field Supply.
    Each record has a list of fruit traded by a seller.
    User can change a supplier for a certain seller, as well as add/remove fruit to/from the list.<br>
    A record in the Suppliers table includes one mandatory field Name.
    Each record has a list of sellers served by such a supplier. User can add/remove sellers to/from the list.<br>
    Upon adding, editing, removal records in tables, lists associated with respective records get automatically updated/deleted.<br>

        (Java, Spring Boot, PostgrSQL)</a>
      is analogous to the previous project except it is rewritten with use of the Spring Boot, and its image is placed in Docker Hub.
      Therefore, unlike the previous project, you do not need such preliminaries as having postgresql service started on your machine, nor
      explicit use of tomcat for starting the project. You can start the app in two ways:
      <ul>
        <li>deploy the app wholy in your machine from the Master branch </li>
        <li>launch <a href="https://github.com/Coder1382/REST-API-Java-PostgreSQL-maven-Spring/blob/feature/docker-compose.yml">
          docker-compose.yml</a> only from the Feature branch to deploy the app from Docker Hub</li>
      </ul>

      <a style="padding-top: 1vh;" href="https://github.com/Coder1382/TCP-Linux-socket">Linux Socket</a> is
      a console application for establishing a TCP connection and data exchange between a server and clients.
      Message sent by a client via the console are dispalyed in the server's console.
      The server saves such an acquired message in a log-file, and echoes it to the client's console.<br>
      The server's console requires one input parameter: the port number. The client's console requires an input string comprising three parameter:
      the client name, port number, and the connection time in seconds.
      An example of making use of the project is provided in the <a href="https://github.com/Coder1382/REST-API-Java-PostgreSQL-Gradle/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>.
      The project is written in C++.

		<a style="padding-top: 1vh;" href="https://github.com/Coder1382/WEB-App-TeleBot">TeleBot</a> is a Telegram app for ordering food online.
		Upon tapping the button "Перейти на сайт" in the webApp bot, the user is redirected to the supplement website where he can choose
		some food by tapping the button "В корзину" under each of food images. Every tap increments the number of food pieces in the user's cart.<br>
		Then the user taps the button "Перейти в оформлению заказа", thereafter the user is asked to fill in a contact form.<br>
		When done, the user taps the button "Оформить заказ", thereupon the user can see his order data in the webApp bot.
		On the other hand, the operator can also simultaneously see the same data in the control bot.<br>
